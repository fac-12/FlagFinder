:crossed_flags: :flags: # Flag Finder :flags: :triangular_flag_on_post:

[Our flag finding site](https://stark-escarpment-83323.herokuapp.com/)

## Why?
Our aim was to create an app that uses autocomplete, presenting the user a list of items to choose from.

## What?
We decided to make an educational app that allows the user to type in the name of a country, pick it from the list and return the user an image of the country's flag.

## How?

* Software architecture
* Backend code - server, router, handlers, JSON data
* Frontend code - API & DOM rendering
* Testing
* Deploying to Heroku
